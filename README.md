# project03_1

Version 3.1 of the project Take Off!

The Take Off projects are my first experience with GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Javascript and lots more stuff. With this projects I am able to study programming while creating a plataform of tests to the ANAC bank, which is related to brazilian civil aviation

The Take Off! 3.1 is the first of the projects to contain all of the 5 ANAC subjects, not only that it also has a timer and a progress bar.
